  2. Install IDE
  3. Fork/Create git repository
  4. Download repository
2. Introduction to Java

4. Theory
  1. Java languadge syntax, structure, separators, operators [1][3][5]
  2. Types, Values, and Variables [2][4][5]
    1. Primitive types and basic types. Difference.


#### Code Tasks

1. Basic
  1. Create simple project in IDE with HelloWorld and check-in it
  2. In project from p. 2. implement the following:
    - solve equation "ax^2 + bx + c = 0"
    - commit into local branch
    - push into your remote repository
    - create pull request to your study repository
  3. Add input from terminal, commit to local, push to remote, create pull request

#### Questions to discuss

What is Java and why we need Java?

What is Git?

Other VCS than Git?

Why we need VCS? Think about collaborative work.

Why we need code review?

What is "extreme programming"? Which principles used?

Difference between basic types and primitives? Why we need them both? Why we need primitive types?

### Task:

Given File with English symbols

When I substitute English symbols with Russian in the file

Then All English symbols should be replaced by Russian ones

1. Making testing sandbox:
  1. Implement or use existing simple algorithm for analyzing substitution in the target file depends on based file.
  2. Create correct base file with substituted symbols to evaluating generated file against base file
  3. Using basic alorithm generate simultaneously 2 files with random symbols: 1st file with English ones and 2nd with appropriate Russian ones.
